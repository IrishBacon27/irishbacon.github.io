        The story of Magic: The Gathering was always focused around extraordinary individuals who were able to travel
        freely within the Multiverse.
        In the early years, these stories would often focus around the plane of Dominaria, Urza, the Weatherlight Crew
        and the Phyrexian invasion. Later, the story started to utilize the block structure of the releases. Each block
        would introduce a new plane, and with the Mending, the story focus would shift towards various Planeswalkers
        who would explore these planes. Some planes would be revisited in later blocks.
        <br><br>
        Novels and comics were the main form of distribution until Magic Story - a weekly short story column - was
        introduced. The paper releases have been discontinued, but the Magic Story is available for free on the Wizards
        of the Coast website.
        <br><br>
        In recent events, Chandra Nalaar, Gideon Jura, Jace Beleren, and Nissa Revane founded the Gatewatch in response
        to the Eldrazi threat. Whenever a plane was in need of help, they would be there to protect its inhabitants.
