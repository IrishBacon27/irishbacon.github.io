            Jon Finkel is a famous American Magic: The Gathering player. Frequently cited as one of the two best
            players of all time, along with Kai Budde, Finkel has more Pro Tour top eight finishes than any other
            player to date, and, for a long time, the most career money winnings in professional Magic history. He was
            inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005 as a member of the inaugural class.
            <br><br>
            Finkel moved with his family to Woking, England in the summer of 1992 and learned about Magic: The
            Gathering shortly thereafter at a local game shop named Fun and Games. After he returned to the New York
            area in 1995 Finkel quickly made friends with the "OMS brothers", Steven and Daniel O'Mahoney-Schwartz.[1]
<br><br>
            In 1996 the first Pro Tour was held in New York. Finkel competed in the Junior Division of the tournament,
            made it to the Top 8, and won a $1,000 scholarship. After reaching another Top 8 in the Junior Division of
            Pro Tour Columbus Finkel had his first appearance in the senior competition of the Pro Tour at the 1996
            World Championship in Seattle. A ninth-place finish earned him $3,200.
<br><br>
            Finkel had three Top 16 finishes in the 1996–97 season, but never made it to the finals. His first Top 8
            appearance was at Pro Tour Chicago 1997. In the same season Finkel won his first Grand Prix title in Rio de
            Janeiro, his first Pro Tour title in New York; finished third at US Nationals and the World
            Championship,[10] and eventually claimed the Pro Player of the Year title.
<br><br>
            The 1998–99 season opened with Finkel winning another Grand Prix in Boston and making his third consecutive
            Top 8 appearance, a feat only once before achieved by Scott Johns. Finkel finished the season second to Kai
            Budde in the Pro Player of the Year race. At the first Team Pro Tour in Washington the following season
            Finkel finished third with his friends and teammates Daniel and Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz. After some
            mediocre finishes in the middle of the season Finkel won the US Nationals as well as the team and the
            individual portion of the World Championship. Eventually Finkel finished third in the Pro Player of the
            Year race. Later in 2000 Finkel also won the Magic Invitational, giving him the chance to design his own
            Magic card. His creation, Shadowmage Infiltrator, debuted in the Odyssey set and was later reprinted in
            Time Spiral and Modern Masters 2015 edition.[11]
<br><br>
            After two additional Top 8 appearances in the 2000–01 season Finkel's performances dropped in the 2001–02
            season. Two Top 8s in 2002–03 were followed by another drop in 2003–04 and eventually by Finkel retiring
            from professional play. In 2005 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame as the vote leader of the inaugural
            class. This allowed him to attend further Pro Tours without having to qualify. In 2008 Finkel thus attended
            and won Pro Tour Kuala Lumpur, becoming the first player to win a Pro Tour after his induction into the
            Hall of Fame. Magic head designer Mark Rosewater commented on the occasion, "[Finkel] is the most naturally
            gifted player the game has ever seen. His accomplishments are rivaled by only one other man [Budde]".
