            Brian McCormick Kibler (born September 7, 1980) is an American collectible card game player, game
            designer, and streamer. In 2016 Kibler helped design Drawing Dead. Previously, he designed Ascension:
            Chronicle of the Godslayer with Justin Gary, Rob Dougherty and John Fiorillo, and worked on Chaotic and
            SolForge and was the lead designer of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game. As of 2016, he is a
            design consultant for Eternal, in addition to streaming and casting Hearthstone and certain associated
            tournaments.
            <br><br>
            Kibler is also a professional card player, and has had great success at Magic: The Gathering with five Pro
            Tour Top 8s, winning Pro Tour Austin in 2009 and Pro Tour Honolulu in 2012. He also has 13 Grand
            Prix Top 8s, winning three of them including the first one held in the 1997â€“98 season and most recently
            Grand Prix Sendai. In August 2004, he won the inaugural VS System Pro Circuit event taking home $40,000
            and a spot in history as the game's first champion. Owing to a pause in his career, he was finally
            inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2010.
            <br><br>
            After taking several years away from Magic (while working at Wizards' direct competitor Upper Deck) he
            returned in 2009. Kibler claims that a major motivating factor for his return was his desire to enter
            the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame, which was created the year following his retirement. Kibler would
            make consecutive Pro Tour Top 8s upon his return, making Top 8 at Pro Tour Honolulu before going on to win
            his first Pro Tour at Pro Tour Austin, defeating Tsuyoshi Ikeda in the tournament finals. By the end of
            the year he placed in the top 10 of the year's best performers on the Magic Pro Tour, achieving enough
            points to guarantee him invites to major championships, free air travel, and a guaranteed appearance fee
            for attending all 2010 events. Additionally, he was tied for 6th among player committee votes of the
            possible entrants for the 2009 Hall of Fame, carrying around 20% of their vote. In 2010, Kibler's high
            performance continued, granting him his third Grand Prix title, another Pro Tour Top 8, and finally
            induction into the Hall of Fame. Kibler was inducted in the Hall of Fame Class of 2010 alongside Gabriel
            Nassif and Bram Snepvangers.

            Kibler also plays the digital card game Hearthstone, winning the ChallengeStone tournaments in May 2015
            and November 2016, the latter taking place at BlizzCon 2016.[ He took second place in the GEICO Brawl #1
            in July 2015. Kibler has also been a commentator on Hearthstone tournaments, including the BlizzCon and
            Championship tournaments. Kibler has been regularly streaming his Hearthstone gameplay on Twitch,
            and has a reputation in the community of being diplomatic, level-headed and rarely becoming angry. He
            prefers Constructed format to Arena.
