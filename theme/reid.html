        Commonly referred to as "The gentleman of the Magic world", Reid Duke started playing in 1995, at age five,
        with his brother Ian Duke, who is now a member of the Magic: The Gathering R&D team at Wizards of the
        Coast. For a time, he was primarily a Magic: The Gathering Online player, but made the transition to in-person
        competitive play. He qualified for Pro Tour Amsterdam 2010 via rating, and won a Magic Online Championship
        Series (MOCS) event to qualify for the 2010 Magic Online World Championship, where he finished 5th, as well
        as the 2010 Magic: The Gathering World Championships in Chiba, Japan. Although his finishes in his first Pro
        Tours were unspectacular, he has not missed a Pro Tour since Amsterdam 2010.

        Duke first experienced success at paper Magic in 2011, when he reached the top eight of two Grand Prix events:
        Grand Prix Providence, where he finished fourth, and Grand Prix Montreal, where he finished fifth. He also won
        another MOCS event to requalify him for the Magic Online Championship, this year held in San Francisco
        concurrently with the 2011 World Championships. Duke ended up winning the event, defeating Florian Pils in the
        final. This qualified him for the inaugural Players Championship event (later renamed the Magic World
        Championship). At Pro Tour Dark Ascension in Honolulu, Duke finished in the money at a Pro Tour for the first
        time, placing 38th.[ From here, he would go on to finish in the money in eight consecutive Pro Tours. He
        also won his first Grand Prix when he defeated Todd Anderson in the final of Grand Prix Nashville. He has
        since 2012 been a part of the team now known as 'The Pantheon', alongside players such as Jon Finkel, Kai Budde
        and Gabriel Nassif.
