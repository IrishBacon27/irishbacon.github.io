            Pro Tours are professional, invite-only tournaments featuring large cash prizes.
            The World Championships were considered a Pro Tour from 1996 to 2011, but were discontinued in 2012.
            When the World Championship was reintroduced in 2013 it was changed to a smaller scale non-Pro Tour event.
            <br><br>
            n 1995, Brand Manager Skaff Elias suggested that organized play needed to take the step to the next level.
            The idea was to run several tournaments each year that would gather the best players in the world and
            reward them with cash for their dedication to the game. Players should have something to aspire to. Elias
            and Mark Rosewater along with others started to work on the concept. On 16–18 February 1996 the first Pro
            Tour, very briefly called The Black Lotus Pro Tour, was held in New York. The first Pro Tour season
            included three more Pro Tour events, culminating in the final Pro Tour, the World Championship, held in
            Seattle. In the following years a Pro Tour season (one year) always consisted of five and later six Pro
            Tours. From 2003 to 2005 Wizards of the Coast made an effort to bring the Pro Tour seasons in accordance
            with the calendar year instead of having the seasons last from August to August the next year. This
            resulted in two seasons of seven Pro Tours. Afterwards Pro Tour seasons were reduced to five and later four
            Pro Tours a year. In 2012, the season schedule was again adjusted, now starting and ending in May.
            Additionally, the World Championship lost its status as a Pro Tour event, resulting in three Pro Tours to
            be held each season. In 2014, the amount of Pro Tours went back up to four a season.
            <br><br>
            Prize payouts have increased slowly over the years from ca. $150,000 per tournament in 1996–97 to $250,000
            in 2012. In the first Pro Tour season each Pro Tour awarded more prizes than the previous one, though.
            Afterwards prize payouts had only minor fluctuations throughout a season with the exception of the World
            Championships which always award some additional prizes.
