    <h1>Magic the Gathering: Pro Tour</h1>
    <p>
        Pro Tours are professional, invite-only tournaments featuring large cash prizes.
        The World Championships were considered a Pro Tour from 1996 to 2011, but were discontinued in 2012.
        When the World Championship was reintroduced in 2013 it was changed to a smaller scale non-Pro Tour event.
